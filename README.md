# BPSCL Turbine Dashboard 🚀

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was developed during my internship at **Bokaro Power Supply Company Ltd (BPSCL)**.  
The goal was to create a predictive analytics dashboard for **turbine health & maintenance** using Excel, Python, and Power BI.

## 📂 Project Structure
- **data/** → Cleaned turbine dataset (`LeaveRequests.xlsx`)  
- **code/** → Python script for predictive modeling (`maintenance_model.py`)  
- **dashboard/** → Interactive Power BI dashboard (`project.pbix`)  
- **report/** → Internship Report (DOCX/PDF)  

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)  
- Microsoft Excel  
- Power BI  
- Power Query  

## 📊 Key Features
- Predictive maintenance using ML (93% accuracy with Decision Tree)  
- Power BI dashboard for interactive insights  
- Data cleaning & preprocessing in Excel and Python
